JavaUtils
=========

  JavaUtils is a library of Java utility classes and packages.

Usage
=====

  The lib/javautils.jar archive is intended to be used as a library to be
  distributed with applications.

  The classes directory contains all compiled classes, including unit
  tests, and is intended to be used during development.

  To use the library, you need to add either the classes directory or the
  lib/javautils.jar archive to your CLASSPATH.

Building
========

  If you downloaded a prebuilt release package, you don't necessarily need
  to build anything.

  In case you really want to build the library, the script directory
  contains project maintenance scripts, including scripts for building the
  library. In order to use the scripts, you should add the scripts
  directory to your PATH. You can then run the scripts from the top level
  directory of this project.

  The Makefile also requires that the PATH includes the script directory.
