    <p>Framework for functional objects.</p>

    <p>
      Representing functions using more complex objects is an instance of
      the Abstraction Inversion-antipattern [<a
      href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractionInversion">Abstraction
      Inversion (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbstractionInversion)</a>]. [Note
      that the antipattern here applies to the design of the Java language
      and also to the idea that we should build functional abstractions on
      top of object-oriented abstractions rather than vice versa [<a
      href="{@docRoot}/overview-summary.html#[Kuhne1999]">K&uuml;hne1999</a>].]
      However, simple functions, rather than more specialized Strategy [<a
      href="{@docRoot}/overview-summary.html#[Gamma1995]">Gamma1995</a>]
      objects, are quite often appropriate for a design and because some
      OO languages, such as Java, do not provide first class functions, it
      makes sense to emulate them using the more complex class mechanism.
